# object_oriented-addition-subtraction-multiplication-distance_calculation
A simple Object Oriented program for addition, subtraction, multiplication of objects and distance calculation

# Point_Representation
in defining classes is to define their __init__ and __repr__ methods so that we can construct and represent distinct objects of that class.Point class accepts two arguments, x and y, and be represented by a string 'Point(x, y)' with appropriate values for x and y.

# Add_Subtract
For two points  (x1,y1)+(x2,y2)=(x1+x2,y1+y2) and similarly for subtraction. `__add__` and `__sub__` methods  allow us to use the + and - operators.

# Multiplication
scalar multiplication given a point  P  and a scalar  a  as `aP=a(x,y)=(ax,ay)`
inner product for points  P,Q as  `P⋅Q=(x1,y1)⋅(x2,y2)=x1x2+y1y2`

# Distance_Calculation
Distance between points P1=(x1,y1) and P2=(x2,y2) can be calcualted as  `D=|P2−P1|= √(x1−x2)2+(y1−y2)2`
